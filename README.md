## Welcome to my Repository :)
This place is my shrine, so is where I can share my code and keep a constant learning rhythm

I'm still a Jr Developer who's fascinated by back-end world..

I want to improve my skills in PHP, Laravel Framework and Node.JS and be as good as I can as professional and person!

I'm open to opportunities. :]
